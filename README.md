## This is just a playground repo.

### On windows.
* right click on this folder and click `Open with Visual Studio Code`.
* This should open the repo in vscode
* hit ` Ctrl + j ` to bring up the terminal and run  `npm i`
* dependencies should be installed now. 
* in the terminal run `npm run debug` to start the program in debug mode
* any change you make to `server.ts` file in `src` folder will be immediately reflected. Program will compile and `re-run` every time you save that file. This feature is quite helpful during the development.
* please have a look at  `tsconfig.json` & `package.json` as these two files define how your project is made up and how it will behave.  


> `.gitignore` is the file that contains files/directories that we want `git` to ignore for now there's only node_modules folder that we want to ignore.
